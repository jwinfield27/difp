## Notes

# idea
- create directory tree
- Take diff from git on specified directory
-- user assumes diff current branch off of specified remote and branch
- Read in the diff from a specified branch
- mark files with a non-empty diff
- Generate description on what each diff might have done

# potential crates
- clap => read cli input
- git2 => git interface
- chatgpt => ai interface
